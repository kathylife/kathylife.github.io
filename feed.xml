&lt;p&gt;Amidst the pandemic, the questions we should now be asking ourselves are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. First and foremost, how fast can the solution be deployed? What corners can be safely cut in order to launch the first version even quicker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it’s not unlike creating a minimum viable product (MVP) in pre-COVID times. However, there is less tolerance for error in what we choose to release now. Also, effectiveness should come before aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. What materials or resources are required for deployment? Would reliance on them lead to a new wave of shortages? And if so, are there any feasible alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. How many people can benefit from the solution? If there is potential to boost that number now or in the future, then excellent! Ultimately though, helping *someone* is better than helping *no one*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, avoid dwelling on this question for too long. Go ahead and implement your prototype even if it will only be helpful to a small group of people at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. How well will the solution scale? Is there room for expansions or even spin-offs when this is all over? If so, great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like #3 though, go ahead regardless. After all, the priority here is to defeat the pandemic. Besides, just as in normal times, a product for everyone is a product for no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. What are some financing options? Whilst I don’t recommend profiting off of commercializing anti-COVID solutions, there are quite a few funding streams that will help accelerate the realization of your social missions. (Just watch out for scams.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">As someone who is actively developing a series of solutions to help fight against COVID-19, I think it’s safe to say that the global crisis presents a paradigm shift in the way we prototype.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Drones</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/drones/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Drones" /><published>2020-03-25T04:04:21+08:00</published><updated>2020-03-25T04:04:21+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/drones</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/drones/">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we are like drones.

&lt;p&gt;What I am currently working on, is an app that lets a deaf person communicate with a blind person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is bringing one of my previous apps* a few steps further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source, living journals are on their way as we speak. Over the last year, I also made the time to get some channel establishments out of the way, including a podcast and a YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That’s a lot of breaking out of comfort zone!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just need to remind myself to update the content more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this new app is also being developed in a “side project” fashion, so dev speed is pretty much the last thing I focus on. That being said, we should see at least a demo sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*In 2019, I built Listenabel, an interface that reads labels aloud. As a side project, its progress has been slow but steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that the home stretch is near — for making the app available for public use, including people who happen to be blind or visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project won’t stop there, though. Nor will I.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Year 2020 has NOT been off to a good start for most of the world, which is why I am now more motivated than ever to squeeze my finite time on Earth to create useful tech.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Data Science Can Only Help So Much</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/26/data-science-can-only-help-so-much/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Data Science Can Only Help So Much" /><published>2020-01-26T18:27:21+08:00</published><updated>2020-01-26T18:27:21+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/01/26/data-science-can-only-help-so-much</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/26/data-science-can-only-help-so-much/">&lt;p&gt;Data science is now a lot more mature than it was back in 2003 (the year when the SARS epidemic struck).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understandably, big data is already playing a big role in helping to fight infectious diseases like Ebola and polio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we leverage data science advancements to speed up the eradication of the latest coronavirus outbreak? That sure is giving scientists some food for thought this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once any of these is used up, there will be no way to replenish it. What’s gone is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the renewability spectrum, we have solar energy, wind power, hydropower — just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was thinking about just now though (using my finite, non-renewable time, no less), is a special type of infinite power. Namely, brain-power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of mind-related resources that we enjoy an abundance of, yet are far too often underutilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples would be knowledge, creativity, and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge, creativity, and kindness normally never run out, if so chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employing or spreading any of the three won’t reduce its total availability at all. In fact, sharing it with others may even inspire people to go on and generate *more* of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you teach someone something, you don’t lose what you know. There isn’t going to be less for others to learn, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create something, it doesn’t take away what you or others may create in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are kind to someone, it doesn’t reduce your own positive energy at all. Plus, kindness is infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an added benefit to consider: Knowledge, creativity, and kindness are major ingredients in coming up with responsible solutions to tackle our resource scarcity problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Coal, petroleum, natural gas… You probably guessed it: I am naming common examples of finite energy resources — finite being the operative word.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Point A to Point B</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/08/31/point-a-to-point-b/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Point A to Point B" /><published>2019-08-31T01:52:21+08:00</published><updated>2019-08-31T01:52:21+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/08/31/point-a-to-point-b</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/08/31/point-a-to-point-b/">&lt;p&gt;Just how long is 50 meters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not dwell on the “what happened” for now, but I just found myself going down a mind-numbing rabbit hole that is having to untangle a 50m ethernet cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I *had* to think about something else in the meantime to prevent myself from going insane. (Or did that not work at all?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usain Bolt could sprint across 50 meters in a little over 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Phelps could swim across a 50-meter pool in a little over 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what about a 50-meter cable full of knots in the middle? Well, technically, you could make both ends touch each other. In other words, the “travel time” between the two points would be zero seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the messy knots didn’t go away at all. The cable would still be tangled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you could always just throw out the tangled cable and get a brand new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that if you didn’t take proper recycling into consideration, you would be producing unjustifiable waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what if you were already halfway through untangling? The longer you waited to take the plunge, the higher your sunk cost (in terms of time) would be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Just how long is 50 meters?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stand Up by Sitting Down</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/08/24/stand-up-by-sitting-down/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stand Up by Sitting Down" /><published>2019-08-24T04:52:21+08:00</published><updated>2019-08-24T04:52:21+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/08/24/stand-up-by-sitting-down</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/08/24/stand-up-by-sitting-down/">&lt;p&gt;I am not a historian, but I read every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Crow laws were a series of American statutes that legalized racial segregation. Existing for about 100 years from as early as 1865 until 1968, the laws were intended to “restore” Southern states to a pre-war class structure by marginalizing African Americans, some of whom were freed slaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black codes were dictated as a legal way to put black citizens into servitude — taking their voting rights away, controlling where they were allowed to live and work, and how they traveled. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Montgomery, Alabama, segregation mandated that the front of a bus be reserved for white residents only, and the seats in the back rows for black residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosa Parks (1913 - 2005) had had enough. She was tired. No, not physically tired. She said she was tired of giving in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 1, 1955, Parks chose to stand up for herself and other African Americans by — interestingly enough — remaining seated. On her commute home from work, the “white” section on the bus was full. The bus driver told Parks to give up her seat in the “colored” section for a white man. Parks refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moments later, two police officers approached the bus, arrested Parks and placed her in custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 5, Parks was found guilty of violating segregation laws in court. She was fined and given a suspended sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her conviction helped initiate the civil rights movement. Black community leaders organized a 381-day bus boycott — led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — during which Parks lost her job and experienced year-long harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boycott would only come to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t all have to be “the mother of the civil rights movement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember this: Every conscious decision we make as a community, everything we did (or didn’t do) collectively on any given day, will inescapably be written into history, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When future generations look back, some events will seem utterly ridiculous to them, some remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stand up for what you believe is right — even if you are literally sitting down, like Rosa Parks was.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">I am not a historian, but I read every now and then.</summary></entry></feed>
