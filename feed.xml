The goal was for it to one day serve as a photographer’s stunt double, so that photojournalists won’t always have to put &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; in danger’s way in chaotic zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The further vision was to repurpose the robot to assist in search and rescue missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/GVRT2KngzvY&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/GVRT2KngzvY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisors: “Our city is a very peaceful place. No one’s ever gonna need your product here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I also built a rescue app. It’s a modernized emergency dispatch system for cases where 999 (911 in the US) calls are just not feasible. The app is blockchain-powered, which means it’s fast and more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/5Cj03FGo358&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/5Cj03FGo358&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisors: “Why would I need this when I could just call 999?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such negative, old-fashioned feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I let that stop me from building things? No, I just stopped listening to “advisors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is that it’s OK to trust our gut instincts and build whatever we believe are worth building. If nothing else, the experience alone is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">In the tail end of 2018, I built a prototype for a robot photographer.

&lt;p&gt;Code committed and pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost forgot how fun it was to work directly with raw data bytes that hardware devices spit out. Except instead of gaming consoles, the development work is now done for healthcare robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just something about being able to see everything clearly in 0s and 1s, so to speak. It either is or isn’t. No gray area. It’s nice to have moments of clarity like this in life every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not all. The organized nerd in me also quite enjoys the part where I get to derive working algorithms from said data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I probably wouldn’t love doing these tasks (as challenging as they are) 7 days a week though. A good balance of all things in moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Late-night ramblings:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Life is Too Short to Build Boring Things</title><link href="https://kathy.life/2019/07/21/life-is-too-short-to-build-boring-things-copy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Life is Too Short to Build Boring Things" /><published>2019-07-21T22:43:21+08:00</published><updated>2019-07-21T22:43:21+08:00</updated><id>https://kathy.life/2019/07/21/life-is-too-short-to-build-boring-things%20copy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kathy.life/2019/07/21/life-is-too-short-to-build-boring-things-copy.html">&lt;p&gt;I have updated the About section of my website a little bit. It now includes some of the questions that I constantly ask myself and reflect upon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you bored by what you do on a daily basis? Can the boring tasks be handled by robots instead? Can &lt;em&gt;YOU&lt;/em&gt; contribute to the design of new robots? What are your ethical guidelines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you uniquely qualified to do? Are you doing what you are uniquely qualified to do? If not, why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you proud of what you do? Will you still be proud of what you do 10 years from now? What about 50 years from now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your dreams? Are there any steps you can start taking today to get closer to those dreams? If you don’t start taking the steps, will you regret it 10 years later? What about 50 years later?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">I have updated the About section of my website a little bit.

&lt;p&gt;As pleasant to use as Medium has been, I have decided to once again move to a self-hosted blog. That way I get to retain control of the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new blog is primarily built with free tools. More specifically, I use Jekyll as the static site generator. The resulting site is hosted on GitHub Pages. The only thing I have to pay for is the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that this will become a consolidated place for all of my ramblings. So future Medium-worthy articles will most likely land here. I may also choose to publish some status updates here instead of up on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not meant to be a social media cleanse, per se. I just quite like the idea of having a central, self-hosted means of content consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">In the past 3 years or so, I have been fortunate enough to garner a humble readership on Medium, publishing both technical and non-technical posts alike.</summary></entry></feed>
