&lt;p&gt;As pleasant to use as Medium has been, I have decided to once again move to a self-hosted blog. That way I get to retain control of the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new blog is primarily built with free tools. More specifically, I use Jekyll as the static site generator. The resulting site is hosted on GitHub Pages. The only thing I have to pay for is the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that this will become a consolidated place for all of my ramblings. So future Medium-worthy articles will most likely land here. I may also choose to publish some status updates here instead of up on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not meant to be a social media cleanse, per se. I just quite like the idea of having a central, self-hosted means of content consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">In the past 3 years or so, I have been fortunate enough to garner a humble readership on Medium, publishing both technical and non-technical posts alike.</summary></entry></feed>
