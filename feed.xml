&lt;p&gt;Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plumes of smoke caught my eye as I headed down the street earlier tonight. My immediate thought — quite understandably — was, “Geez, is that tear gas?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seconds later, it struck me that there had been a fire at a construction site just a stone’s throw away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely a few more seconds later, fire trucks began to arrive at the scene. As it turns out, I wasn’t the only one who happened to be nearby. The district’s fire station is literally just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of my footage, at least one ambulance can be seen arriving as well. I hope everyone’s safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the amazing first responders: Thank you very much for your service! My hats off to you on this Thanksgiving day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once any of these is used up, there will be no way to replenish it. What’s gone is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the renewability spectrum, we have solar energy, wind power, hydropower — just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was thinking about just now though (using my finite, non-renewable time, no less), is a special type of infinite power. Namely, brain-power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of mind-related resources that we enjoy an abundance of, yet are far too often underutilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples would be knowledge, creativity, and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge, creativity, and kindness normally never run out, if so chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employing or spreading any of the three won’t reduce its total availability at all. In fact, sharing it with others may even inspire people to go on and generate *more* of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you teach someone something, you don’t lose what you know. There isn’t going to be less for others to learn, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create something, it doesn’t take away what you or others may create in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are kind to someone, it doesn’t reduce your own positive energy at all. Plus, kindness is infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an added benefit to consider: Knowledge, creativity, and kindness are major ingredients in coming up with responsible solutions to tackle our resource scarcity problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Coal, petroleum, natural gas… You probably guessed it: I am naming common examples of finite energy resources — finite being the operative word.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Point A to Point B</title><link href="https://kathy.life/2019/08/31/point-a-to-point-b-copy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Point A to Point B" /><published>2019-08-31T01:52:21+08:00</published><updated>2019-08-31T01:52:21+08:00</updated><id>https://kathy.life/2019/08/31/point-a-to-point-b%20copy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kathy.life/2019/08/31/point-a-to-point-b-copy.html">&lt;p&gt;Just how long is 50 meters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not dwell on the “what happened” for now, but I just found myself going down a mind-numbing rabbit hole that is having to untangle a 50m ethernet cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I *had* to think about something else in the meantime to prevent myself from going insane. (Or did that not work at all?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usain Bolt could sprint across 50 meters in a little over 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Phelps could swim across a 50-meter pool in a little over 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what about a 50-meter cable full of knots in the middle? Well, technically, you could make both ends touch each other. In other words, the “travel time” between the two points would be zero seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the messy knots didn’t go away at all. The cable would still be tangled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you could always just throw out the tangled cable and get a brand new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that if you didn’t take proper recycling into consideration, you would be producing unjustifiable waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what if you were already halfway through untangling? The longer you waited to take the plunge, the higher your sunk cost (in terms of time) would be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Just how long is 50 meters?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stand Up by Sitting Down</title><link href="https://kathy.life/2019/08/24/stand-up-by-sitting-down.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stand Up by Sitting Down" /><published>2019-08-24T04:52:21+08:00</published><updated>2019-08-24T04:52:21+08:00</updated><id>https://kathy.life/2019/08/24/stand-up-by-sitting-down</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kathy.life/2019/08/24/stand-up-by-sitting-down.html">&lt;p&gt;I am not a historian, but I read every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Crow laws were a series of American statutes that legalized racial segregation. Existing for about 100 years from as early as 1865 until 1968, the laws were intended to “restore” Southern states to a pre-war class structure by marginalizing African Americans, some of whom were freed slaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black codes were dictated as a legal way to put black citizens into servitude — taking their voting rights away, controlling where they were allowed to live and work, and how they traveled. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Montgomery, Alabama, segregation mandated that the front of a bus be reserved for white residents only, and the seats in the back rows for black residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosa Parks (1913 - 2005) had had enough. She was tired. No, not physically tired. She said she was tired of giving in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 1, 1955, Parks chose to stand up for herself and other African Americans by — interestingly enough — remaining seated. On her commute home from work, the “white” section on the bus was full. The bus driver told Parks to give up her seat in the “colored” section for a white man. Parks refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moments later, two police officers approached the bus, arrested Parks and placed her in custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 5, Parks was found guilty of violating segregation laws in court. She was fined and given a suspended sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her conviction helped initiate the civil rights movement. Black community leaders organized a 381-day bus boycott — led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — during which Parks lost her job and experienced year-long harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boycott would only come to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t all have to be “the mother of the civil rights movement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember this: Every conscious decision we make as a community, everything we did (or didn’t do) collectively on any given day, will inescapably be written into history, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When future generations look back, some events will seem utterly ridiculous to them, some remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stand up for what you believe is right — even if you are literally sitting down, like Rosa Parks was.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">I am not a historian, but I read every now and then.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Acknowledge Its Existence</title><link href="https://kathy.life/2019/08/16/acknowledge-its-existence-copy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Acknowledge Its Existence" /><published>2019-08-16T03:56:21+08:00</published><updated>2019-08-16T03:56:21+08:00</updated><id>https://kathy.life/2019/08/16/acknowledge-its-existence%20copy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kathy.life/2019/08/16/acknowledge-its-existence-copy.html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s late-night ramblings are in regard to something that one cannot see, but undoubtedly exists nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking what I was thinking? I was going to say — blind spot; or perhaps more than one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take driving. It’s possible that there will be multiple blind spots at any given time, depending upon things like the type of vehicle you are in, your height, your peripheral vision, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irresponsible drivers risk not only their own life, but that of others who share the road, if they make reckless maneuvers without compensating for blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compensating for — or even finding ways to completely eliminate — blind spots doesn’t take much time and effort at all, and yet could literally save lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just have to be willing to take that step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in order to be able to act willingly and accordingly, we have to first acknowledge that they are there. We all have blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Today’s late-night ramblings are in regard to something that one cannot see, but undoubtedly exists nonetheless.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Likelihood</title><link href="https://kathy.life/2019/07/31/likelihood.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Likelihood" /><published>2019-07-31T05:04:21+08:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T05:04:21+08:00</updated><id>https://kathy.life/2019/07/31/likelihood</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kathy.life/2019/07/31/likelihood.html">&lt;p&gt;I could tell something must have gone wrong. The last stretches of the highway leading up to Tai Lam Tunnel — including the 3.8-kilometer tunnel itself — were brought to a complete standstill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there was a crash involving two double-decker buses, injuring 77 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I ramble on, I’d like to wish everyone who’s injured a speedy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to be minutes behind the crash. While I was stuck in the heavy traffic with nothing better to do, I couldn’t help but sat there and overthought the situation a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the days of traditional statistics, the mathematical analysis would be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the odds of being involved in that accident, out of…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who were headed that direction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taking that particular means of transportation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At that specific time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Plus a whole bunch of other factors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, the result isn’t something that’s alarming at all. But at the same time, the ballpark figure also isn’t telling you much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Data Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is modern-day data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How likely is it for someone to be involved in that accident, given:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of past accidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That occurred in the proximity of the crash site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around the same time of the day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a similar model of vehicle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing, though. The prediction can range from wildly inaccurate to highly accurate, depending upon various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has enough data been used? Is the data relevant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have enough elements been taken into account? Did we forget to consider things like weather, driver’s physical state, materials used, et cetera et cetera?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is precisely the danger of relying too heavily on half-baked, “data-driven” “A.I.” algorithms in any decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have shared similar thoughts on these risks in some of my past talks, except with different cases and scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(But now it’s time for me to go to bed and stop overthinking random things for a few hours.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">I could tell something must have gone wrong.

The goal was for it to one day serve as a photographer’s stunt double, so that photojournalists won’t always have to put &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; in danger’s way in chaotic zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The further vision was to repurpose the robot to assist in search and rescue missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/GVRT2KngzvY&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/GVRT2KngzvY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisors: “Our city is a very peaceful place. No one’s ever gonna need your product here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I also built a rescue app. It’s a modernized emergency dispatch system for cases where 999 (911 in the US) calls are just not feasible. The app is blockchain-powered, which means it’s fast and more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/5Cj03FGo358&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/5Cj03FGo358&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisors: “Why would I need this when I could just call 999?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such negative, old-fashioned feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I let that stop me from building things? No, I just stopped listening to “advisors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is that it’s OK to trust our gut instincts and build whatever we believe are worth building. If nothing else, the experience alone is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">In the tail end of 2018, I built a prototype for a robot photographer.

&lt;p&gt;I almost forgot how fun it was to work directly with raw data bytes that hardware devices spit out. Except instead of gaming consoles, the development work is now done for healthcare robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just something about being able to see everything clearly in 0s and 1s, so to speak. It either is or isn’t. No gray area. It’s nice to have moments of clarity like this in life every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not all. The organized nerd in me also quite enjoys the part where I get to derive working algorithms from said data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I probably wouldn’t love doing these tasks (as challenging as they are) 7 days a week though.
